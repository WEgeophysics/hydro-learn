# hydro-learn: *An intelligent solver for hydrogeology engineering issues*


##  Overview

*Hydro-learn* is a Python-based package for solving hydro-geology engineering issues. From methodologies based on 
Machine Learning, It brings novel approaches  for reducing numerous losses during the hydrogeological  
exploration projects. It allows to: 
- reduce the cost of hydraulic conductivity (K) data collection during the engineering projects,
- guide drillers for to locating the drilling operations, 
- predict the water content in the well such as the level of water inrush, ...

## Licence 

*hydro-learn* is under [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) License. 

## Installation 

The system requires preferably Python 3.10+.

### Predict hydraulic conductivity ``K`` from logging dataset using MXS approach
 
MXS stands for mixture learning strategy. It uses upstream unsupervised learning for 
``K`` -aquifer similarity label prediction and the supervising learning for 
final ``K``-value prediction. For our toy example, we use two boreholes data 
stored in the software and merge them to compose a unique dataset. In addition, we dropped the 
``remark`` observation which is subjective data not useful for ``K`` prediction as:

```python

import hlearn
h= hlearn.fetch_data("hlogs", key='h502 h2601', drop_observations =True ) # returns log data object.
h.feature_names
Out[3]: Index(['hole_id', 'depth_top', 'depth_bottom', 'strata_name', 'rock_name',
           'layer_thickness', 'resistivity', 'gamma_gamma', 'natural_gamma', 'sp',
           'short_distance_gamma', 'well_diameter'],
          dtype='object')
hdata = h.frame 
```
``K`` is collected as continue values (m/darcies) and should be categorized for the 
naive group of aquifer prediction (NGA). The latter is used to predict 
upstream the  MXS target ``ymxs``.  Here, we used the default categorization 
provided by the software and we assume that in the area, there are at least ``2`` 
groups of the aquifer. The code is given as: 
```python 
from hlearn.api import MXS
mxs = MXS (kname ='k', n_groups =2).fit(hdata) 
ymxs=mxs.predictNGA().makeyMXS(categorize_k=True, default_func=True)
mxs.yNGA_ [62:74]
Out[4]: array([1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
ymxs[62:74]
Out[5]: array([ 0,  0,  0,  0, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12])
```
Once the MXS target is predicted, we call the ``make_naive_pipe`` function to 
impute, scale, and transform the predictor ``X`` at once into a compressed sparse 
matrix ready for final prediction using the [support vector machines](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/708428) and 
[random forest](https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest) as examples. Here we go: 
```python 
X= hdata [h.feature_names]
from hlearn.utils.mlutils import make_naive_pipe
Xtransf = make_naive_pipe (X, transform=True) 
Xtransf 
Out[6]: 
<218x46 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
	with 2616 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format> 
Xtrain, Xtest, ytrain, ytest = hlearn.sklearn.train_test_split (Xtransf, ymxs ) 
ypred_k_svc= hlearn.sklearn.SVC().fit(Xtrain, ytrain).predict(Xtest)
ypred_k_rf = hlearn.sklearn.RandomForestClassifier ().fit(Xtrain, ytrain).predict(Xtest)
```
We can now check the ``K`` prediction scores using ``accuracy_score`` function as: 
```python 
hlearn.sklearn.accuracy_score (ytest, ypred_k_svc)
Out[7]: 0.9272727272727272
hlearn.sklearn.accuracy_score (ytest, ypred_k_rf)
Out[8]: 0.9636363636363636
```
As we can see, the results of ``K`` prediction are quite satisfactory for our 
toy example using only two boreholes data. Note that things can become more 
interesting when using many boreholes data.
